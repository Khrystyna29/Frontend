            <h2 class="recipe-title">Macarons</h2>
            <p>One of the most famous desserts in the country. These delicious cakes are made with almond flour, egg whites, powdered sugar, granulated sugar and food coloring. The shell of a successful pasta should be both crispy and easy to melt in the mouth. The filling, be it jam, butter cream or ganache, should always be in sufficient quantity!
                Traditionally popular macaron flavors were chocolate, vanilla and caramel. Today, pastry chefs are very creative and created from selling products from all over the world to offer original macarons in a variety of colors and flavors.</p>

            <h2 class="recipe-title">Yogurt biscuit</h2>
            <p>You need natural yogurt, a little milk and butter. The most elementary decoration is powdered sugar with cocoa. A biscuit can be turned into a festive dessert. We found this yogurt biscuit on Polish resources and it is for those who are always in a hurry, but like to have fresh baked goods on the table.
                The stage with butter is very important. It must be properly softened to an almost liquid state, and then brought to room temperature.</p>

                <h2 class="recipe-title">Lemon tart with meringue</h2>
                <p>A true favorite of the French, tarte au citron meringuée, or lemon meringue tart, is undoubtedly one of the most popular and beloved desserts in the world. The lemon meringue tart is essentially a development of the original tarte au citron (lemon tart). Tarte au citron is a shortbread filled with lemon curd made from egg yolks, lemon zest, juice and sugar. Tarte au citron meringueée takes this classic recipe and adds a top layer of short-baked, tender and airy meringue.</p>

            <h2 class="recipe-title">Croissant</h2>
            <p>A croissant is a symbolic pastry that is traditionally served in the morning for breakfast with coffee or hot chocolate. In France, it is customary to eat it plain or, for real gourmets, cut it in half, lightly fry it and spread it with butter and jam or chocolate paste! Croissant can be found in any bakery (French: boulangerie) throughout the country! It is made from puff pastry containing yeast. According to the French confectioner Christophe Felder, to prepare a perfect croissant, you need to master 50 parameters!</p>

                <h2 class="recipe-title">Walnut-rum cupcake</h2>
                <p>A delicious nut cake will complement any celebration or an ordinary tea party. The pastry turns out to be quite high in calories, while maintaining its lightness and delicate texture.
                    Dark rum gives the dessert a spicy note and a characteristic dark color, and walnuts give it a bright taste. The dough is neither mushy nor heavy, but rather tender and soft. In addition to nuts, you can also add dried fruits. By the way, the Spaniards love this dessert and call it Bizcocho con nueces.</p>

                <p>Like most ingenious things, chocolate ice cream on a stick, which we all used to call popsicles, appeared completely by accident. It happened when Christian Kent Nelson, the owner of a candy factory for children, once covered an ice cream bar with chocolate frosting.</p>
